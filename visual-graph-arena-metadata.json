The datasets are structured around three primary concepts, each divided into two tasks.\n1. **Graph Isomorphism Tasks**:\n    - *Easy Isomorphism*: Determining whether two given graphs are isomorphic, with non-isomorphic graphs chosen randomly.\n    - *Hard Isomorphism*: Determining whether two given graphs are isomorphic, with non-isomorphic graphs being degree-equivalent.\n    \n2. **Graph Path Finding Tasks**:\n    - *Hamiltonian Path*: Determining whether a given graph contains a Hamiltonian path.\n    - *Shortest Path*: Finding the shortest path length between two marked nodes in a graph.\n    \n3. **Graph Cycle Finding Tasks**:\n    - *Hamiltonian Cycle*: Determining whether a given graph contains a Hamiltonian cycle.\n    - *Biggest Chordless Cycle*: Finding the size of the largest chordless cycle in a graph.\n"}
